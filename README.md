# GhostN-Goblins-RemakeProject
I've created a remake of the iconic first stage and final stage of the 1985 arcade classic Ghosts 'n Goblins, adding my own unique twist to the gameplay.

In my version, the frog transformation isn't just a setback – it's a whole new playstyle! 

The frog now wields its own weapon, introducing fresh mechanics and strategies that bring a new layer of excitement to the nostalgic experience.
